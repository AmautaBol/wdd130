        <p>Hello! My name is Giancarlo Teran Olguin and I am from Cochabamba, Bolivia, and I love traveling to
            different
            places in my homeland, Bolivia. Cochabamba has a wide variety of cuisine, from
            traditional dishes like "Pique Macho" to the delicious "Anticucho". I invite you to visit it anytime. I
            have
            high expectations for this Software Developer career, to acquire the knowledge and be able to start my
            own
            business providing technological solutions to my community and the world. </p>
